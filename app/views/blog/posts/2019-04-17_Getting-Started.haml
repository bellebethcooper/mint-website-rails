  %li Immutable data structures and functional programming elements
  %li HTML like syntax for HTML elements and components
  %li Everything included:

  %ul
    %li routing
    %li support for components
    %li styling with CSS
    %li standard library
    %li data store (like Redux)
    %li development server
    %li formatter
    %li environment variable handling
    %li test runner
    %li documentation server
    %li JavaScript interoperability

  %li Optimized output (minified, mangled)
  %li
    %a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination")
      Dead code elimination
  %li A single binary which contains the whole toolchain
  %li Uses React a Platform
  %li and more awesome features...

%h2 Installation

%p
  Mint comes as a single binary file:

  = succeed "." do
    %code mint

  To install it please follow the instructions on
  %a(href="/install")
    the install page
  (basically download the binary and add it to the PATH).

%h2 Creating a new project

%p
  Once you have Mint installed you can create a new project with the
  %code mint init
  command:

%pre
  %code.plaintext
    :escaped
      mint init my-awesome-project

%p
  If successful you should see this:

%pre
  %code.plaintext
    :escaped
      Mint - Initializing a new project
      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      ⚙ Creating directory structure...
      ⚙ Writing initial files...

      There are no dependencies!

      There is nothing to do!
      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      All done in 2.231ms!

This creates the following directory / file structure:

%pre
  %code.plaintext
    :escaped
      my-awesome-project
      ├── source
      │   └── Main.mint
      ├── tests
      │   └── Main.mint
      ├── .gitignore
      └── mint.json

%h2 Development server

%p
  Mint comes with a built-in development server which recompiles the code (and
  reloads the browser) when something changes, to start it go into the project
  directory and run the
  %code mint start
  command:

%p
  If successful you should see this:

%pre
  %code.plaintext
    :escaped
      Mint - Running the development server
      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      ⚙ Ensuring dependencies... 181μs
      ⚙ Parsing files... 2.608ms
      ⚙ Development server started on http://127.0.0.1:3000/

%p
  Now you can open the running project on
  %code http://127.0.0.1:3000/
  or
  %code http://localhost:3000/


%p
  If the project is running you should see this:

= image_tag 'getting_started_1.png'

%p
  Now you are up and running with a Mint project locally 🎉

%h2 Online Playground

%p
  If you just want to mess around without installing, you can use the
  %a{href: ENV['SANDBOX_URL']}
    sandbox on the website.
