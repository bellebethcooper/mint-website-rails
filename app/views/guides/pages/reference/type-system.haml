%h1 Type System

%p
  In Mint the types and type definitions are only for the type checker and compiler,
  they are not available or used by the runtime.

%p
  Because of that types can be defined in any type definition (except Records and Enums),
  so for example if
  %code Time
  is not defined as an
  %code Enum
  or
  %code Record
  when writing this:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      module Time {
        fun now : Time {
          ...
        }
      }

%p
  will define
  %code Time
  as a type.

%p
  Since only this function defines this as a return type we can safely use the
  same type in type signatures of other functions:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      fun day (date : Time) : Number {...}
      fun format (pattern : String, date : Time) : String {...}

%p
  because the
  %code Time.now()
  is the only place values of
  %code Time
  can come from.
